# 🌐 Personal Website 🌐
My first version of my personal website! https://nicholas-lin.com

If you want to learn more about me, my past experiences or projects, here's a great source! I haven't gotten around to redesigning a new one, so this code is rather outdated, but I try to keep the content updated :)

# 🐱‍💻 How I Built it

Created the website with [React](https://reactjs.org/) from scratch using [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html). The website is designed with Sass (mainly because I like the formatting of Sass and wanted to try it out).

The website is deployed using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

# 🧠 Challenges I Ran into and What I Learned

Finding the right colour scheme was definitely a big challenge I ran into, probably took me much longer than I should've because I was very stubborn about having yellow in there. For future designing, websites such as [Coolers](https://coolors.co/) and [FontPair](https://www.fontpair.co/) are definitely useful resources to use!

This was also the first time I used github pages, and I stumbled a little as I mistakenly installed like 200 packages and caused vulnerable dependencies and whatnot on this Github Repo, but at the end it worked out fine 😊.

## This project was created with the [Solid CLI](https://github.com/solidjs-community/solid-cli)
